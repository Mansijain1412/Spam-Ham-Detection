# Spam-Ham-Detection

This spam-ham detection system that uses machine learning techniques to classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). It is implemented using Python and leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in email classification.

The main goal of this is to develop an effective spam-ham detection system that can accurately classify incoming emails. Spam emails are unsolicited messages that can be malicious, while ham emails are legitimate messages from trusted sources. By distinguishing between the two, this system helps users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful content from their inboxes.
